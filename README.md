## Custom Features & Plugins

### Elixir Development

- **LSP, Treesitter, and Neotest** for Elixir, HEEx, and EEx.
- **Credo linting** via both `none-ls` and `nvim-lint` (ensure only one is active to avoid duplicate diagnostics).
- **Test/Implementation Switcher**: Quickly jump between test and implementation files. If the test file doesn't exist, it will be scaffolded.
- **Debug Keymap**: `<leader>cD` appends `|> dbg()` to the current line in Elixir files.
- **Test Runner**: Keymaps for running nearest test, file, suite, last, and visiting test files.

### CSV Tools

- Enhanced CSV navigation and text objects.
- Excel-like navigation with `<Tab>`, `<S-Tab>`, `<Enter>`, `<S-Enter>`.

## Usage Notes

- **Elixir Test/Implementation Switcher**: Use `<leader>mti` in an Elixir file to jump between test and implementation. If the target file doesn't exist, it will be created with a template.
- **Feed Reader**: Use `<leader>rf` to open, `<leader>ru` to update feeds.
- **Copilot Chat**: Use `<leader>aa` to toggle, `<leader>aq` for quick questions.
- **CSV Navigation**: Use `<Tab>`, `<S-Tab>`, `<Enter>`, `<S-Enter>` in CSV files for fast navigation.
